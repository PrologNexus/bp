# Interpreter for a Prolog Subset using Warren Abstract Machine
> Interpreter podmnožiny Prologu pomocí Warren Abstract Machine  

> Get acquainted with the Prolog programming language [1,2], and the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) [2] for the execution of Prolog.  
> Implement interpreter and REPL for a subset of Prolog using WAM.  
> Your subset must support at least Horn clauses and cuts.  
> Verify the functionality of your implementation by testing with a relevant set of sample codes.
